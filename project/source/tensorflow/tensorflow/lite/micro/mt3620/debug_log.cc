// Reference implementation of the DebugLog() function that's required for a
// platform to support the TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers library. This is
// the only function that's absolutely required to be available on a target
// device, since it's used for communicating test results back to the host so
// that we can verify the implementation is working correctly.
// It's designed to be as easy as possible to supply an implementation though.
// On platforms that have a POSIX stack or C library, it can be written as a
// single call to `fprintf(stderr, "%s", s)` to output a string to the error
// stream of the console, but if there's no OS or C library available, there's
// almost always an equivalent way to write out a string to some serial
// interface that can be used instead. For example on Arm M-series MCUs, calling
// the `bkpt #0xAB` assembler instruction will output the string in r1 to
// whatever debug serial connection is available. If you're running mbed, you
// can do the same by creating `Serial pc(USBTX, USBRX)` and then calling
// `pc.printf("%s", s)`.
// To add an equivalent function for your own platform, create your own
// implementation file, and place it in a subfolder with named after the OS
// you're targeting. For example, see the Cortex M bare metal version in
// tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/bluepill/debug_log.cc or the mbed one on
// tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/mbed/debug_log.cc.
